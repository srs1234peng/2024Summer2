1. How is onChange prop different from onChangeText prop?
(1) the parameter type is different. onChange provides an event object, while onChangeText returns the new text value.
(2) so if we are sure that we only need text value, onChangeText is more convenient, as onChange need extra steps to extract the text value.
(3) onChange, is more suitable for various event handling cases.

2. How can you mask the text input for passwords?
We could utilize the secureTextEntry property of TextInput component. 
If true, the text input obscures the text entered so that sensitive text like passwords stay secure. 
When secureTextEntry is set to true, the input text will be hidden, making it suitable for password fields.
